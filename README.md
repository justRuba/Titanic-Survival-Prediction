# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers using a Logistic Regression model. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers who were aboard the Titanic. This project aims to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and fare.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The dataset includes the following columns:

- `PassengerId`: Passenger identifier
- `Survived`: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Name`: Passenger name
- `Sex`: Passenger sex
- `Age`: Passenger age
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Fare paid
- `Cabin`: Cabin number
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

- describe() provides summary statistics for numerical columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles. corr() Calculates correlation coefficients (-1 to 1) to identify the strength and direction of linear relationships between features and survival in the Titanic dataset.

- The plot shows the distribution of survival outcomes in the Titanic dataset. It displays the count of passengers who survived (Survived = 1) versus those who did not survive (Survived = 0).

## Data Preprocessing

# Handle missing values:

- Fill missing Age values with the mean age.

- Drop the Cabin column due to a high percentage of missing values.
