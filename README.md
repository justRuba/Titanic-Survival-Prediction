# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers using a Logistic Regression model. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers who were aboard the Titanic. This project aims to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and fare.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The dataset includes the following columns:
